## Note to contributors  
If you're making changes to the stored procedures, do change the version numbers there, in the workbench and here.

## New additions:
- Merged of the Old Backend with ours
- Added `helpers` folder, `timeperiodtype.sql` ; these helper stored procedures change the database so as to facilitate smooth running of the timeperiodtype stored procedure.
